# Dinstances (Web API)
This project is a Java-based web API that consists of two applications: a server and a client. The server application generates a random "map" by randomly assigning positions (x, y) or (latitude, longitude) to n cities. It provides two interfaces:

- City Location Retrieval: This interface allows users to retrieve the position of a city based on its name.
- Distance Calculation: This interface enables users to calculate the distance between two cities.

The client application provides a visualization of the selected cities' locations and calculates the length of the path between them in the order specified by the user.
